# Dark Web: Historical Background (Sanitized)

## 1. Origins of Anonymity on the Internet

- In the 1990s, the U.S. Navy developed **The Onion Routing (Tor)** protocol to enable secure and anonymous communications for military and intelligence operations.
- The **Tor Project** later became open-source, allowing the public to use similar anonymity protections.

> Tor was released publicly to blend official government traffic with general anonymous users, making it harder to trace communication patterns.


## 2. Birth of the Dark Web (Early 2000s)

- **2002:** First version of the **Tor network** released for public testing.
- **2004:** The Tor Project was officially launched.
- With Tor came `.onion` hidden services — unindexed websites accessible only through Tor.


## 3. The Rise of Hidden Services

- The `.onion` domain system supports anonymous services, including:
  - Whistleblowing portals
  - Investigative journalism sites
  - Forums, private communities, and research networks


## 4. Early Darknet Marketplaces (2011–2013)

- **2011:** Launch of one of the first major darknet marketplaces, known for anonymous transactions.
- Specialized in illicit goods such as drugs, fake documents, and hacking tools.
- **2013:** The marketplace was seized by law enforcement and its founder arrested.
- This led to other markets emerging, many of which were later shut down by international operations.


## 5. Ransomware & Leak Sites (2019–Present)

- Some ransomware groups operate **.onion leak sites** to:
  - Publicly list compromised organizations
  - Pressure entities into paying ransoms
- Well-known examples exist, but names and URLs are omitted here for security and compliance.
- Typical leak site structure:
  - Organization name or placeholder
  - Industry sector and country
  - Countdown timers
  - Proof-of-breach samples (redacted in this version)


## 6. Modern Use Cases of the Dark Web

**Legitimate Uses**:
- Circumventing censorship in restricted regions
- Secure whistleblowing to journalists
- Privacy-respecting communication

**Illicit Uses**:
- Cybercrime platforms (details omitted for safety)
- Sale of stolen or counterfeit goods
- Fraud-related tools and services
