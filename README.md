# Dark Web Intelligence Research — Public Version

This repository is the **sanitized public release** of a **private GitHub repository** that contains ongoing dark web intelligence research.  
The private repository is used for collecting, analyzing, and storing sensitive intelligence data. All such data has been carefully reviewed, **sanitized**, and **redacted** before inclusion here.


## Purpose
The goal of this public version is to:
- Share general findings, methodology, and technical insights from the research.
- Provide educational and awareness resources for cybersecurity professionals, students, and OSINT researchers.
- Maintain ethical and legal compliance by **removing or anonymizing any illicit or identifying content**.


## Sanitization Process
Before files are added to this repository:
- All `.onion` links are removed or replaced with `[REDACTED]`.
- Victim names, personal data, and sensitive identifiers are replaced with generic placeholders (e.g., *"Company A"*).
- Leaked documents or files are not included — only structural mockups with fake data are provided.
- HTML samples are offline mock versions with no live connections.


## Structure
- **0_overview/** — Dark web history, glossary, and executive summaries.
- **1_infrastructure/** — Anonymous backend architecture, search engines, and OPSEC guidelines.
- **2_platforms/** — Sanitized forum showcases, including a safe mockup of *Dread* and discussion on the *Red Rooms* myth.
- **3_ransomware_groups/** — Profiles of ransomware groups (status, TTPs) with sanitized leak page samples.
- **methodology.md** — Research approach, safety precautions, and tooling.
- **scraper.md** — List of ransomware leak sites that the tool can parse, with no active URLs.


## Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational, awareness, and academic research purposes only**.  
It does **not** contain any illegal, harmful, or sensitive material.  
The private research repository from which this content is derived is **not public** and contains operational data that is handled securely.
